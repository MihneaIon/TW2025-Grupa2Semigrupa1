<div class="right"><h1>Volunteer Positions</h1>
We could always use a hand- we can't ensure universal access to all knowledge without your help. Whether it's helping Open Library update their UI, setting up A/V equipment at Internet Archive events, or helping the Wayback Machine archive even more of the internet, you will have a permanent impact on our goal of free access to all information for everyone.
<br><br>
When you volunteer for the Internet Archive, you get behind-the-scenes access to a non-profit workplace with a big mission. You'll get to work with a wide variety of people, ranging from Archive staff to fellow volunteers from all walks of life. You'll be able to refine your networking, event planning, and team building skills while having fun, meeting new people, and attending Archive events.

<br><br>
Volunteers are essential during our special events. We host around 30+ events annually, and volunteers provide crucial support by engaging with guests, assisting with set-up and break down, A/V support, and other exciting opportunities. Volunteers are expected to be punctual and reliable and be flexible and cooperative with staff, guests, and other volunteers. The majority of our events are held in the San Francisco Bay Area, mostly at our headquarters in San Francisco.

[ Due to COVID-19 closures, we are temporarily suspending Special Event Volunteer applications. Please check back with us soon! ]
